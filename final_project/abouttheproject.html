                <h4>Love a Clay</h4>
                <p>I have a friend who really wanted me to join her for taking ceramic class at the local art center. I did not really had time to take the class, but I did get to teach elementary school kids class later, the school needed help with the clay project.  So that was the first time I had chance to try working with clay and see how engaging kids were, how exciting it was for them to make something out of pile of mud.</p>  
				<p> My friend went on setting up a studio in the garage where she spend all her free time working with clay and experimenting with that media and sharing her hobby. </p> 
			<p>So Idea of building a website for a hobby with potential extending into a business area was something I wanted to try, thus was the idea behind our project, to design website that can be adopted by many small businesses or people who has hobby and want to share it with others </p>
